Here are some ideas under discussion for the next major revision of
the SANE API:

 o Additional image data types, such as JPEG, MPEG, FlashPix, raw.
   These would be useful for devices that directly generate such
   formats (still cameras, for example).  The raw image format could
   be used when no other format is applicable.  This would allow to
   at least read and save the data in a file.  This would probably
   have to be coupled with adding a function that lets a frontend
   tell the backend what level it supports, something like
   sane_set_level (int max_supported_level).
   [Based on suggestion by Andreas Beck <becka@charon.rz.beck-sw.de>]

 o Support for other multimedia types, such as audio.  This probably
   would also require adding a write() interface to the SANE API.
   [Suggested by Erik Troan <ewt@redhat.com>.]
