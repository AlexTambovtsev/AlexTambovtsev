Under HP-UX, it is necessary to add options -Aa and -D_HPUX_SOURCE to
the compiler flags when using HP's C compiler (not gcc).  This can be
done by invoking configure with:

	CC=cc CPPFLAGS=-D_HPUX_SOURCE CFLAGS=-Aa ./configure

HP's make utility may have problems with some of the Makefiles, if it
complains about missing separators, please try gmake (GNU make).
