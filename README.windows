SANE on Cygwin/Win32

Prerequisites
=============

To be able to compile sane-backends, you need to have Cygwin installed, with at least the following package(s):
  - gcc

You can get Cygwin at http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/

The scanner must be detected by Windows and not be disabled. Check
with the hardware manager.


Scanning
========

If you have more than one scanner, you should do the following:

  - run sane-find-scanner to get the device name of the scanner. The
    name is something like h0b0t6l0, meaning hba 0, bus 0, scsi id 6 and
    lun 0.

  - edit the config file for the backend
    (/usr/local/etc/sane.d/xxxx.conf) and add the scanner device name on
    an empty line.

Run "scanimage > out.pnm" to get a scan.

xscanimage and XSane also work. xscanimage compiles and runs out of
the box. XSane 0.92 needs a couple build fixes.


Limitations
===========

The current annoying limitations are:
  - Only SCSI scanners will work. No USB/FireWire/Parallel.
  - Tested on Windows 2000 only. Should work on Windows NT/XP too;
    may or may not work on Windows 95/98/ME.

Note: there is a Cygwin libusb port (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libusb-win32) so USB scanners might work too.
