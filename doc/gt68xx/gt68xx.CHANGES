* Fixed firmware name for Mustek 1248 UB. Changed status to basic. Removed
  "unsupported" warning.
* Added workaround for shared memory compilation problem on Windows.
* It's now possible to add a new vendor/product id line to gt68xx.conf to test
  yet unsupported scanners without changing the source code.

V 1.0.62 (2004-08-08)

* Added detection for Mustek ScanExpress 1248 UB. It's untested however and I
  don't even know the name of the firmware.
* Added new id for Mustek BearPaw 1200 CU Plus (0x021b). It's completely untested.

V 1.0-61 (2004-06-18)

* General:
  * Re-enabled forked reader process when fork is not disabled. That's faster
    with high resolutions and big scan widths.
  * In gray and lineart mode the color to be used can be selected now.
  * Resolution and depth lists are now in the "correct" order.
  * Fixed "move to the end" bug when full scan is enabled.
  * Used SANE_VALUE_SCAN_MODE_* macros.
  * Added debugging code for brightness/calibration.
  * Changed status of Genius Colorpage Vivid4x too good.
  * Removed special command set for U16B (and Genesys Vivid4) as those scanners
    are quite normal GT6816 devices.
  * Removed special test for gt6816, 600 dpi, 16 bits -> linemode. The other
    tests should change the settings to linemode if necessary.
  * Added flag to indicate that a scanner doesn't support linemode. Print an error
    if linemode is activated for that sort of scanners.
  * Adjusted various debug levels.
  * Added options to force backtracking and to set the number of lines to
    backtrack.
  * Increased default lamp-warmup time to 60 seconds. Also lamp-warmup doesn't
    stop if lamp brightness is 0.

  * Removed XDBG macros. Used DBG instead.
  * Checks for correct gain and offset are in gt68xx_generic now.
  * Fixed gain setting (including multiplier).
  * Check for status of read_scanned_data every 10 ms. Avoids short stops before
    scan data comes in.
  * Added resolution limit for using backtracking.
  * Reduced deafult CCD backtracking to 0x10 lines.
* CCD coarse calibration:
  * Check if calib has succeeded per color now (fewer loops).

  * Changed debug messages.
* CIS coarse calibration:
  * Removed offset multiplier.
  * Changed limits.
  * Changed debug messages.
  * Incresed exposure count.
  * Removed special lamp-warmup in CIS calibration.
  * CIS coarse calibration now does gain and offset at the same time
    similar to CCD calibration. This change should avoid loops.

  * Fixed black mark.
  * Use CCD calib now.
  * Use inverted offset.
  * Warm up for 10 seconds minimum.

  of the BearPaw 1200 CU Plus doesn't seem to like that.

V 1.0-43 (2003-03-06)

- Small requests are done with a response buffer of 8 bytes (instead of 64)
  now. Looks like GT-6816 based scanners return 8 bytes if the firmware is
  loaded and 64 bytes if it's not loaded.
- Changed GT-6816 firmware check to ignore errors from above change. 
  GT-6816 scanners work with the BSDs now (at least once).

- Increase the lowest black for CCD coarse calibration to avoid too much black.
- Adjusted internal gamma correction to avoid getting 0 for high gamma values.

  problem with extremly high gains and terrible quality cal in gray mode at
  least for the BearPaw 1200 TA.
--> Thanks to Alexei V. Mezin for reporting these bugs.

- Bugfix: Mirroring code had an off-by-one error (garbage in the first column).
- Artec Ultima 2000, MD 9385: Removed 1200 dpi mode (doesn't seem to work?),
  added 100 and 200 dpi modes. Renamed model to Artec Ultima 2000, because
  that's probably the "father" of all the clones.
- Mustek BearPaw 1200 CU: Added 200 dpi mode.
- Added manual page.
- Removed override for Packard Bell (seems to be exact Bearpaw 1200 CU Plus
  clone).
