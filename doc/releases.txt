This text summarizes some points to pay attention to when a new realease
of sane-backends should be made.

Before the release:

* configure.in: increase version number
* configure.in: set --disable-warnings as default
* configure: recreate
* net.c net.desc dll.c dll.desc: update version numbers
* NEWS: update and enter date of release
* sane-backends.lsm: update
* ChangeLog: set release marker
* final compilation test
* make distclean
* tag CVS with release tag: 'cvs tag RELEASE_1_0_4'
* make diff from last release: 'cvs diff -uNr RELEASE_1_0_3 > sane-1.0.4.diff'

Making the release:

* remove all CVS files from directories (CVS, .cvsignore etc.)
* make tar.gz and sane-backends-x.y.z.lsm
* upload both to mostang.com
* make sane-backends.html and upload to mostang.com
* update SANE standard and man pages on mostang.com
* check and update platforms page on mostang.com
* write announcements on mostang.com and sane-devel, maybe others
  (e.g. freshmeat)
* upload to mirrors that don't get the files automatically (sunsite
  and tsx11)

After the release:

* configure.in: set --enable-warnings as default
* configure: regenerate
