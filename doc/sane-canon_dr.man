.SH NAME
sane\-canon_dr \- SANE backend for Canon DR-series scanners

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B sane\-canon_dr
library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which
provides access to some Canon DR-series scanners.

This document describes backend version 26, which shipped with SANE 1.0.20.

.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
This version has only been tested with a few scanner models. Please see 
http://www.sane\-project.org/sane\-supported\-devices.html for a more recent 
list.

This backend may support other Canon scanners. The best
way to determine level of support is to test the scanner directly,
or to collect a trace of the windows driver in action.
Please contact the author for help or with test results.

.SH OPTIONS
Effort has been made to expose most hardware options, including:
.PP
source s 
.RS
Selects the source for the scan. Options
may include "Flatbed", "ADF Front", "ADF Back", "ADF Duplex".
.RE
.PP
mode m 
.RS
Selects the mode for the scan. Options
may include "Lineart", "Halftone", "Gray", and "Color".
.RE
.PP
resolution, y\-resolution
.RS
Controls scan resolution. Setting \-\-resolution also sets \-\-y\-resolution, 
though this behavior is overridden by some frontends.
.RE
.PP
tl\-x, tl\-y, br\-x, br\-y
.RS
Sets scan area upper left and lower right coordinates. These are renamed 
t, l, x, y by some frontends.
.RE
.PP
page\-width, page\-height
.RS
Sets paper size. Used by scanner to determine centering of scan
coordinates when using ADF and to detect double feed errors.
.RE
.PP
Other options will be available based on the capabilities of the scanner:
enhancement, compression, buttons and sensors, etc.

Use 'scanimage \-\-help' to get a list, but be aware that some options may 
be settable only when another option has been set, and that advanced options 
may be hidden by some frontend programs.
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
The configuration file "canon_dr.conf" is used to tell the backend how to look
for scanners, and provide options controlling the operation of the backend.
This file is read each time the frontend asks the backend for a list 
of scanners, generally only when the frontend starts. If the configuration
file is missing, the backend will fail to run.
.PP
Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 4 ways:
.PP
"scsi CANON DR"
.RS
Requests backend to search all scsi busses in the system for a device 
which reports itself to be a scanner made by 'CANON', with a model name
starting with 'DR'. 
.RE
.PP
"scsi /dev/sg0" (or other scsi device file)
.RS
Requests backend to open the named scsi device. Only useful if you have
multiple compatible scanners connected to your system, and need to
specify one. Probably should not be used with the other "scsi" line above.
.RE
.PP
"usb 0x04a9 0x1603" (or other vendor/product ids)
.RS
Requests backend to search all usb busses in the system for a device 
which uses that vendor and product id. The device will then be queried
to determine if it is a Canon scanner.
.RE
.PP
"usb /dev/usb/scanner0" (or other device file)
.RS
Some systems use a kernel driver to access usb scanners. This method is untested.
.RE
.PP
Besides the 'scsi' and 'usb' lines, the configuration file supports the 
following 'option' lines:
.PP
"option buffer-size [number of bytes]"
.RS
Set the number of bytes in the data buffer to something other than the 
compiled\-in default of 4MB. Large values may cause timeouts or hangs, small
values may cause slow scans.
.PP
Note: The backend does not place an upper bound on this value, as some users
required it to be quite large. Values above the default are not recommended,
and may crash your OS or lockup your scsi card driver. You have been
warned.
.RE
.PP
"option vendor-name [string of text]"
.br
"option model-name [string of text]"
.br
"option version-name [string of text]"
.RS
These options can be used collectively to override the values provided by the 
scanner, or to provide the values when the scanner cannot.
.RE
.PP
"option padded-read [0|1]"
.RS
Some scanners prepend all data transmitted to host with 12 bytes. Enable this option if the scanner fails to respond to commands.
.RE
.PP
Note: 'option' lines may appear multiple times in the configuration file.
They only apply to scanners discovered by the next 'scsi/usb' line.
.PP

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The backend uses a single environment variable, SANE_DEBUG_CANON_DR, which
enables debugging output to stderr. Valid values are:
.PP
.RS
5  Errors
.br
10 Function trace
.br
15 Function detail
.br
20 Option commands
.br
25 SCSI/USB trace
.br
30 SCSI/USB detail
.br
35 Useless noise
.RE

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
This backend was entirely reverse engineered from usb traces of the proprietary 
driver. Various advanced features of the machines may not be enabled. Many
machines have not been tested. Their protocol is unknown.
