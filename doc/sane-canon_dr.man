.SH NAME
sane\-canon_dr \- SANE backend for Canon DR-series scanners

.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B sane\-canon_dr
library implements a SANE (Scanner Access Now Easy) backend which
provides access to some Canon DR-series scanners.

This document describes backend version 8, slated to ship with SANE 1.1.0.

.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
This version has only been tested with the DR\-9080C and DR\-7580. Please see 
http://www.sane\-project.org/sane\-supported\-devices.html for a more recent 
list.

This backend may support other Canon scanners. The best
way to determine level of support is to test the scanner directly,
or to collect a trace of the windows driver in action.
Please contact the author for help or with test results.

.SH OPTIONS
Effort has been made to expose most hardware options, including:
.PP
source s 
.RS
Selects the source for the scan. Options
may include "Flatbed", "ADF Front", "ADF Back", "ADF Duplex".
.RE
.PP
mode m 
.RS
Selects the mode for the scan. Options
may include "Lineart", "Halftone", "Gray", and "Color".
.RE
.PP
resolution, y\-resolution
.RS
Controls scan resolution. Setting \-\-resolution also sets \-\-y\-resolution, 
though this behavior is overridden by some frontends.
.RE
.PP
tl\-x, tl\-y, br\-x, br\-y
.RS
Sets scan area upper left and lower right coordinates. These are renamed 
t, l, x, y by some frontends.
.RE
.PP
page\-width, page\-height
.RS
Sets paper size. Used by scanner to determine centering of scan
coordinates when using ADF and to detect double feed errors.
.RE
.PP
Other options will be available based on the capabilities of the scanner:
enhancement, compression, buttons and sensors, etc.

Use 'scanimage \-\-help' to get a list, but be aware that some options may 
be settable only when another option has been set, and that advanced options 
may be hidden by some frontend programs.
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
The configuration file "canon_dr.conf" is used to tell the backend how to look
for scanners, and provide options controlling the operation of the backend.
This file is read each time the frontend asks the backend for a list 
of scanners, generally only when the frontend starts. If the configuration
file is missing, the backend will use a set of compiled defaults, which
are identical to the default configuration file shipped with SANE.
.PP
Scanners can be specified in the configuration file in 4 ways:
.PP
"scsi CANON"
.RS
Requests backend to search all scsi busses in the system for a device 
which reports itself to be a scanner made by 'CANON', with a model name
starting with 'DR'. 
.RE
.PP
"scsi /dev/sg0" (or other scsi device file)
.RS
Requests backend to open the named scsi device. Only useful if you have
multiple compatible scanners connected to your system, and need to
specify one. Probably should not be used with the other "scsi" line above.
.RE
.PP
"usb 0x04a9 0x1603" (or other vendor/product ids)
.RS
Requests backend to search all usb busses in the system for a device 
which uses that vendor and product id. The device will then be queried
to determine if it is a Canon scanner.
.RE
.PP
"usb /dev/usb/scanner0" (or other device file)
.RS
Some systems use a kernel driver to access usb scanners. This method is untested.
.RE
.PP
The only configuration option supported is "buffer\-size=xxx", allowing you
to set the number of bytes in the data buffer to something other than the 
compiled\-in default, 65536 (64K). Some users report that their scanner will
"hang" mid\-page, or fail to transmit the image if the buffer is not large
enough.
.PP
Note: This option may appear multiple times in the configuration file. It only
applies to scanners discovered by 'scsi/usb' lines that follow this option.
.PP
Note: The backend does not place an upper bound on this value, as some users
required it to be quite large. Values above the default are not recommended,
and may crash your OS or lockup your scsi card driver. You have been
warned.
.PP

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The backend uses a single environment variable, SANE_DEBUG_CANON_DR, which
enables debugging output to stderr. Valid values are:
.PP
.RS
5  Errors
.br
10 Function trace
.br
15 Function detail
.br
20 Option commands
.br
25 SCSI/USB trace
.br
30 SCSI/USB detail
.br
35 Useless noise
.RE

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
This backend was entirely reverse engineered from usb traces of the proprietary 
driver. Various advanced features of the machines may not be enabled. No small 
machines or flatbed models have been tested. Their protocol is unknown.
