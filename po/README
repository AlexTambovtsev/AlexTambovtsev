This directory contains translations for the options of the SANE backends.
They are only used if configure is called with option --enable-translations.
Currently these translations are only used by XSane.

What do you need to do if you want to:

- Just read the description of SANE options in your language
  * Use XSane, read the documentation and set LANG to your favorite
    setting (e.g. de_DE for German in Germany).

- Update existing translations when the source code has changed
  * cd po ; make update-po
  * Edit backend.lang.po, add/change translations. 
  * make

- Add a new language
  * cd po ; make update-pot
  * cp backend.pot backend.lang.pot
  * Edit backend-lang.po, enter translations. Don't forget to edit the header.
  * make update-mo ; make install

- Add a translation for a backend that is not listed yet in Makefile.in
  * Edit your sources and add SANE_I18N to the appropriate strings. Mark the
    descriptions (desc) and titles of options with SANE_I18N(). Do the same
    for string lists used in options. The name of options must NOT be marked.
    Do NOT mark macros. Especially you don't need to mark standard option
    strings like SANE_TITLE_NUM_OPTIONS as this is already done in saneopts.h.
    Example: s->opt[5].title = SANE_I18N("Enhancement");
  * Edit Makefile.in. Add your backend to ALL_BACKENDS and ass a line
    "backend.pot: yourfiles" where yourfiles is a list of all your files 
    containing translatable text.
  * configure --enable-translations
  * cd po ; make update-pot
  * cp backend.pot backend.lang.pot
  * Edit backend-lang.po, enter translations. Don't forget to edit the header.
  * make update-mo ; make install

Bugs:
- This is the first attempt to support translations. It's probably very buggy
  and nearly untested.
- Lot's of ugly tricks and asumptions in Makefile.in
- Documentation isn't finished
