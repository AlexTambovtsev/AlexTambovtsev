SANE test suite
===============
Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@td.org.uit.no>

This is a test framework for the Scanner Access Now Easy project
(SANE).  Please add more tests.  This framework should be able to test
everything without installing, to make sure a new distribution is
function properly before the old one is replaced.  If it isn't, please
fix the bug. :-)

The current test needs the pnm backend. Hint: 
"configure --enable-pnm-backend".
