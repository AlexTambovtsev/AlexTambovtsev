SANEI test suite
================

This directory contains test programs for sanei functions. They are compiled
and run by 'make check'.

sanei_usb_test
---------------
	 Tests sanei_usb_* functions. No USB scanner needs to be plugged,
but in this case less code is covered (open/close and claim/release 
of real devices).
Function currently tested are:
	- sanei_usb_init()
	- sanei_usb_open(): valid, invalid devname, already opened
	- sanei_usb_get_vendor_product_byname(): valid and invalid devname
	- sanei_usb_get_vendor_product(): valid and invalid devname
	- sanei_usb_close()
	- sanei_usb_exit()
	- store_device()
