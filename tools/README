This directory contains various tools that may be useful:

        Attempts to find a SCSI scanner attached to your system.
        Invoke with "sane-find-scanner -h" to get command-line
        syntax. Note that sane-find-scanner will find any scanner
        that is connected to a SCSI bus.  It will even find scanners
        that are not supported at all by SANE. More details can be
        found in the man page sane-find-scanner(1).

 xerox:
        A simple script to make photocopies ("xeroxing").  In
        the script, you may need to adjust the device name
        assigned to variable DEV and the resolution assigned

 umax_pp:
	Command line utility to scan on UMAX astra 1220P,
	1600P and 2000P, without using the backend. So that

        Some handy elisp stuff to automagically generate descriptive
        SANE webpages from backend .desc files with emacs. Look at the
