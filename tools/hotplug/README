README for the hotplug scripts for sane-backends :
--------------------------------------------------

If you intend to use a USB scanner with libusb, you should install the hotplug
package, and then take the following steps :
  o copy the libsane.usermap and libusbscanner files from this directory to
    /etc/hotplug/usb/
  o add scanner to /etc/hotplug/blacklist so that the scanner.o kernel driver
    won't be loaded by hotplug.
  o edit /etc/hotplug/usb/libsane.usermap, and add a line similar to the one
    given at the top of the file, replacing 0xVVVV and 0xPPPP with the vendor ID
    and the product ID of your scanner, respectively.

The vendor ID and product ID of your scanner can be obtained by running
sane-find-scanner (you might need to run it as root).

Please note that the scanner.o (or scanner.ko in Linux 2.6) kernel module is
now deprecated and marked as obsolete in Linux 2.6. It is recommended to switch
to libusb.

If the hotplug support doesn't work for you once you have taken the steps
described above, check that your kernel has been built with hotplug support.
Otherwise, you'll need to rebuild your kernel.
